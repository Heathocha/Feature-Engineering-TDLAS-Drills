# Feature-Engineering-TDLAS-Drills
In the notebook attached, you will see the exercise walkthrough of the 'Feature Engineering' section.  The exercise is to look at the ESS dataset and identify what the variables are and whether they are categorical or continous.  If the variables are continous, further identification is needed to show if it's ordinal, interval, or ratio.
What is the difference between a categorical and continuous variable?
Categorical variables contain a finite number of categories or distinct groups (gender, country, etc).
Contiunous variables are numeric variables that have an infinit number of values between any two values (can be numeric or date/time)
Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio variables
Ordinal - indicate rank order. They are often treated like categorical features in analyses, because it doesn't make sense to use them in most mathematical operations.
Interval - indicated both rank-order and distance. Temperature is a good example. Interval variables can be treated as either categorical or continuous features, depending on how comfortable you are with the assumption made by most models that a continuous variable naturally has an absolute zero point.
Ratio - indicate rank, distance, and a meaningful absolute zero value. When a ration has a score of 0, we know that none of the quantity measured by the variable is present. A good example is age
